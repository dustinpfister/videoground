# constants.js

This is where I park any kind of value that I will want to get at from more than one other file. This started when I put my REVISION const  as well as an object that I use for the userData lib in the preload.js file. I then needed to use the userData lib in both preload.js and menu.js, so to fix the problem of having more than one place to store the same object I started this lib.
