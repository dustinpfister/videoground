# user-data.js

This is for creating and updating a state in the form of a json file in the current users home folder. It is based off of my electronjs example that I started for the sake of a blog post on this subject. The main thing about this is to just have somehting that will create a folder and file if it is not there, and to update the state of that file as needed.
