# Videoground

I wanted to make a real electronjs powered project that is a simple tool for making videos using threejs, vuejs, and a whole lot of vanilla javaScript code of my own. VideoGround is then the project that I came up with that I use to make videos that I post to [youtube at my javaweaver channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/javaweaver). So be sure to check out the channel if you would like to see what some content looks like using this tool.

The core idea of what I think this project should do is to just simply create a collection of png files for each frame as a means of exporting. Once I have a collection of images from there I can use a tool like ffmpeg to create a video file. Once I have a video file making a final product will then involve using additional software tools such as audacity, MuseScore, and OpenShot to add audio and preform any additional final processing type tasks.

## Getting this to work well on raspberry pi os

I like using raspberry pi computers and with that the raspberry pi os Linux based operating system. With that I have run into a lot of problems getting various things to work that have to do with 3d. For one thing I like to use blender to make DAE Files, but late versions of blender will not work on raspberry pi OS because the openGl requirements are to high. Still as far as getting video ground itself to work on rpi I have had success by making use of some fixes with flags when calling the electronjs binary, and also using older versions of the electronjs binary and thus also nodejs and chrome.

### Be sure to call the electronjs binary with the no-sandbox flag

I can into a problem with syscall 0403 when trying to run the electronjs binary on a late version of raspberry pi os \( bullseye \). I have [found a solution to this](https://github.com/electron/fiddle/issues/900) that involves passing the no sandbox flag when calling the electronjs binary. So I added this to the start script of the package.json file. So when I do a npm start the flag will be used.


```
  "scripts": {
    "start": "electron --no-sandbox ."
  },
```

### The latest is not always the greatest

Late versions of electronjs will not work at all, or will work with significant problems. So then I am keeping the version of electronjs and thus also node and chrome fixed at the latest revisions of cretin older major releases. Revisions r0 threw r5 have been using 10.4.7 of electronjs.

```
r0 – r5:
  electron: 10.4.7
  node: 12:16.3
  chrome: 85.0.4183.121
```

On raspberry pi os buster chromium 90.x is used, and on bullseye I am seeing 101.x when it comes to the builds in the official repos that are installed out of the box. So when updating to later versions of electronjs I will likely want to keep things in that range. Bleeding edge versions of electronjs using chrome 104+ do not seem to be working so great at the time of this writing.


## What the goals are with this project

When it comes to what the goals are in terms of adding features there is only so much that I might want to add. If I do keep working on this I am going to end up completing the core set of features that I want. Once that is done I am going to want to be a little more reserved about adding features, choosing to move forward with features that I only really truly want and need. In fact as of r3 I would say I am all ready at a point where the goal is to just refine the features that I all ready have in place.

## Official js files

On top of the core of what videoground is I should also have a number of official javaScript files that are to be used with video javaScript files. When I make an additional content repository I will want to have javaScript files that center around what the nature of the content is that I might not want to include in the core of videoground itself. Still there are some usual suspect module that I will likely want to include in the core of videoground. What I have in terms of these javaScript modules can be found in the start videos folder as of r5.

## Official start-videos

In the start-videos folder I have a number of video files that are intended to be starting points for projects, but are also used to just demonstrate features of videoground itself, as well as official additional features such as the canvas.js file to create canvas textures.

## Creating a video from frame images with ffmpeg

If I have a folder of png files in the range of 'frame-0000.png' to 'frame-9999.png', then using ffmpeg with the -i option should work with the value 'frame-%04d.png'. I will then want to add any additional options such as setting the framerate, and of course I will want to give an output file.

```
$ ffmpeg -framerate 30 -i frame-%04d.png -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4
```

## Getting this working

with the root of this folder as the current working folder just do an npm install, and then an npm start.

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
