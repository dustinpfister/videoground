## Known problems
* () - #0 - I have to disable CSP to get vuejs to work in the html files that I use in the html folder
* () - #1 - I am using eval to run javaScript code in the textarea element in html/js/client.js
* () - #2 - WINDOWS: when I reload from dev tools some times the video loads other times it does not in windows
* ( fixed in r1 ) - #3 - textures for dea files do not show up until frame+ or frame- is clicked
* ( fixed in r3 ) - #4 - WINDOWS: texture files will not load correctly in windows
* ( fixed in r2 ) - #5 - script tags keep being added each time a video is loaded
* ( fixed in r5 ) - #6 - it looks like scripts are not run in order of the index value, this should be the case
* ( fixed in r5 ) - #7 - syscall 0403 error running on rpi os bullseye see: https://github.com/electron/fiddle/issues/900
* ( fixed in r6 ) - #8 - videoAPI.webGL2-test-pass set true
* () - #9 - videoAPI.webGL2-test-pass still false when read client side look into another way to store state
* () - #10 - error loading dae textures when loading from more than one folder

## () - r10 - Write data frame by frame
* (done) start video21-r10-start.js
* (done) have a simple sine wave
* (done) just log what the sample data will be for now until I have write features working.
* (done) To keep things simple this video21-r10-start.js start video will just write the same byte for all samples
* (done) start module called writer-append to see about getting something up and running with a writing option
* (done) I will want a read me file for append-writer and at least one test file
* (done) make writer append part of the public api
* (done) use new writer method video21-r10-start
* (done) v21: create\_sine\_points helper function
* (done) v21: create sine points should take a total size argument
* (done) v21: there is then giving an index, and count relative to the size
* (done) v21: create sine points 2 should return an array of numbers not vector2 objects
* (done) v21: do away with old create sin points method
* (done) v21: create array disp helper method
* (done) v21: create sine points 3 : options object
* (done) v21: create sine points 3 : step option
* (done) v21: create array disp : use step option of create sine points 2 in in place of bytes per frame
* (done) v21: create array disp : step should go up with size of bytes per frame to a certin max value
* (done) v21: VIDEO.render : current frame display
* (done) v21: worked out a draw sample data method that seems to work okay, and if not is extensible
* (done) v21: VIDEO.render : playback overlay for total sound disp
<!-- video22 -->
* () v22: start video22-r10-samp-amplitude.js based off of video21
* () v22: see about working out a way to adjust amplitude over time using curves


<!-- range read needs more work -->
* () range-read: the method going to less confusing options when it comes to the use of opt.buffer\_size\_alpha
* () range-read: Maybe the way to do this is that of the buffer size option is used at all that will result in a whole other mode
* () range-read: There is then having a default mode where I can give direct byte values if I just happen to know them
* () range-read: speaking of knowing them, I might want another mode where I just get file stats, mainly the size of the file

<!-- final work -->
* () README update
* () REVISION in constants.js, and package.json set to 10 and commit with message '0.10.0'
